# Pile

> Organize your piled work at one place.

[README](https://github.com/mtobeiyf/pile/blob/master/README.md)

## Why Pile?

The way we get things done is project-oriented. However, the files, applications, tasklists, etc. are scattered everywhere. Pile is a place for you to put them altogether.

## Usage

Before we get started, let me help you get it more clear how to use Pile.

### Board

A board (or tab) is a place to hold all the resources of your **project** or **workspace**. You can organize your things related to the project/workspace using *hubs*.

### Hub

A hub (or card) is an area for specific stuff. There are three different kinds of hubs:

- **App/File**: You can add apps or files you may use in this area so that you can quickly access them.
- **Notes**: Online resources (often appeared as links) or your thoughts can be taken down here.
- **Todo**: A simple todolist related to the project.

## Features


### Download

Go to the [release page](https://github.com/mtobeiyf/pile/releases)
and download the portable **zip** file.
Unzip it and run `Pile.exe`.
